# Canederli Code

I love coding, but I'm not a professional programmer. Until today, I've kept my code to myself.  Now I've decided to publish it - why not? The code is as is, but you might find some scripts useful.

Why did I call this repository canederliCode? Because it's mainly spaghetti code. I'm Italian and live in Trentino, a region in northern Italy. Canederli (Kn√∂dels) are a typical dish from my region. So, this repository isn't a collection of spaghetti code, but rather canederli code.
